# Let's create a program to organize our entertainment stuff
# Create classes for these 4 types of data
# games have a name, studio, hours to finish, hours played
# films have a name, studio, length in minutes, minutes watched
# tv shows have a name, studio, number of episodes, number of episodes watched
# books have a name, author, number of pages, number of pages read
# can these classes inherit the same class?
# make all their variables private
# on each object we can mark our progress and can see in percentage how much have we finished

# create a class in which we can add our stuff we watch/play/read
# and through it we should be able to mark our progress
# and we can see our whole list of stuff or only a type (for example the books)
# and we can see things we have finished, in progress or not even started
# to keep this list persistent (to not lose the data),
# the object should have a save method which saves the data into a file
# and we should be able to reconstruct the object from the data in a file
